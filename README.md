The project was the fulfilment of the academic project of Digital Logic and Circuit course.

The team members were:

1. Ajinkya Bedekar

2. Biren Sharma

3. Shantanu Bahuguna

4. Yogesh Sharma

The repository consists of the following:

1. Source code of the project which can be uploaded to Arduino

2. Project report

3. Video explaining the functioning of the project

4. Schematic of RFID Based Security System

The components used in this project are:

1. Resistors

2. LED

3. RFID Module

4. RFID Tag

5. Arduino

6. Servo Motor

7. Wooden Door

8. Hinge

9. Latch

Procedure followed by our team was:

1. Firstly, make a small door with the help of Wooden Door, Hinge, and Latch.

2. Then, attach the Servo Motor to the Latch with the help of a strong wire so that it can pull the latch to open the door.

3. Also, attach the Arduino, RFID Module, LED, and Resistors to the door as explained in the Schematic.

4. Next, connect Arduino to the laptop and upload the source code with the help of Arduino IDE with some minor changes such as the RFID number, etc.

5. Once the code is uploaded, the project is ready to use.

6. Finally, scan the RFID Tag and check that the door opens on successfully scanning the RFID and the LED glows up.
